I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), interested in foundational ML models, especially computer vision and multimodal representation learning. I like building research-oriented projects and turning them into clean demos.

Edmund James Scholar  
Interests: multimodal learning, representation learning, vision-language models  
Current focus: training/evaluating models and building simple web demos

Outside of CS: self-taught piano, light novels/manga (Your Lie in April)

## Tech and tools

Languages: C++, Python

A lot of my public GitHub activity is coursework and practice:
- C++ debugging and testing exercises (including Catch2)
- data-structure style assignments (queues, tic-tac-toe, CSV parsing)
- Python coursework repo(s)

## Featured work

Vision–Language / Multimodal
- CLIP ViT-B/32 fine-tuning and web demo: fine-tuned model plus a portfolio-style demo app

Coursework / practice
- C++ and Python course repositories and assignments, with a focus on correctness, testing, and debugging

## What I’m working on next

- Better experiment tracking and reproducibility for ML projects
- Clearer documentation and model cards for released projects
- More polished demos and evaluations for research projects
