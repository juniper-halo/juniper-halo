I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), interested in foundational ML models, especially computer vision and multimodal representation learning. I like building research-oriented projects and turning them into clean demos.

Edmund James Scholar  
Interests: multimodal learning, representation learning, vision-language models  
Current focus: training/evaluating models and building simple web demos
